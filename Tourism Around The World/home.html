        Todaiji is one of Japan's most famous and historically significant temples <br>
        and a landmark of Nara.The temple was constructed in 752 as the head temple <br>
         of all provincial Buddhist temples of Japan and grew so powerful that the <br>
         capital was moved away from Nara in 784 in order to lowerthe temple's<br>
          influence on government affairs.

           Several smaller Buddhist statues and models of the former<br>
          and current buildings are also on display in the Daibutsuden Hall.<br>
          Another popular attraction is a pillar with a hole in its base <br>
          that is the same size as the Daibutsu's nostril.<br>
          It is said that those who can squeeze through this opening will be<br>
           granted enlightenment in their next life.<br>
