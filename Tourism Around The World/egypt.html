        <b>Egypt’s bustling capital city is layered with cultural, religious, architectural and even culinary history. Its wonders stretch far beyond the walls of its famous museums. You can take in centuries worth of sights just by walking down the city streets, and discover untapped wonders just by saying hello to a stranger. Then there are the Pyramids of Giza, truly a wonder of the world.<br>              
        At the epicenter of history in the core of the city is Islamic Cairo, the city's most atmospheric quarter. Just grab your camera and venture down its vibrant alleyways. Take in the views from the Citadel and the old city gates – known as Bab Zuweila, Bab al-Futuh and Bab an Nasr – and admire the intricate details of the area’s stunning mosques. The ancient Mosque of Muhammad Ali, Ibn Tulun Mosque and Al-Hakim Mosque are particularly incredible. Islamic Cairo is also home to monument-lined Muizz Street and Khan El-Khalili bazaar – great spots to grab some souvenirs (if your haggling skills are up to the task).

       The site of the magnificent ancient city of Thebes, Luxor is said to preserve a third of the world’s ancient monuments between the pillars of its majestic temples. Dubbed the world’s greatest open-air museum, the capital of Upper Egypt recently celebrated the grand reopening of the 2.7km (1.7 mile) Avenue of the Sphinxes, an ancient thoroughfare connecting Karnak Temple, home of the famed Temple of Amun-Ra, and the impressively preserved Luxor Temple.
                    
       A sunrise hot air balloon ride will give you a captivating bird's-eye view of this city of ancient wonders. Once you're back on the ground, head to Hatshepsut Temple and Medinet Habu – two massive ancient architectural wonders that feature prominently on travelers' Instagram feeds – and cross the river to the Valley of the Kings, the royal burial site of Tutankhamun, Seti I and Ramses II.<br>

       Alexandria city once housed the world’s biggest library and was a jeweled outpost for the Greco-Roman empires. Since then, little remains of the fabled places in the city, but the city has become one of the best Egypt destinations away from the grind and dust of the rest of the Egyptian cities. The Pompey pillar square is a great place to hang out, and the streets are lined with chic cafes in a welcome break from the cuisine elsewhere in Egypt.<br>

        Sitting in isolation, in the western corner of the Western Desert, Siwa is the tranquil tonic to the hustle of Egypt's cities. This gorgeous little oasis, surrounded by date palm plantations and numerous hot-water springs, is one of the Western Desert's most picturesque spots.

        Siwa town is centered around the ruins of a vast mud-brick citadel, known as the Fortress of Shali, which dominates the view, while various temple remnants, including the Temple of the Oracle where Alexander the Great is said to have come to receive advice, are scattered throughout the wider oasis area.
        
        This is a top spot to wind down and go slow for a few days, as well as being an excellent base from which to plan adventures into the surrounding desert.<br>

      Egypt is defined by the Nile. For many visitors, a multi-day cruise upon this famed waterway that saw the rise of the Pharaonic era is a highlight of their Egypt trip.
                    
      Cruising the Nile is also the most relaxing way to see the temples that stud the banks of the river on the route between Luxor and Aswan, plus sunrise and sunset over the date-palm-studded river banks, backed by sand dunes, is one of Egypt's most tranquil vistas.
                    
       The two famous sights on a Nile Cruise are the Temple of Kom Ombo and Edfu's Temple of Horus, where all the big cruise boats stop.
                    
       If you'd prefer a less crowded and slower experience, though, and don't mind "roughing it" a bit, you can also cruise the Nile by felucca (Egypt's traditional lateen-sailed wooden boats), which also allows you to create your own itinerary.
                    
       The vast amount of cruise boat itineraries depart from either Luxor or Aswan, but feluccas can only be chartered for multi-day trips from Aswan.<br>
