    <span style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 25px; padding: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 50px; font-family: Arial;">The Tower of Pisa</span>, or the "Leaning Tower of Pisa," is one of Italy's most iconic landmarks. Situated in the city of Pisa, this freestanding bell tower is renowned for its dramatic tilt, the result of a foundation settling in unstable soil during its construction in the 12th century. The tower's white marble exterior, adorned with intricately carved columns and arches, contrasts beautifully against the blue Tuscan sky. While the tower's unintentional lean is its most striking feature, its historic and architectural significance cannot be overlooked. Visitors from around the world come to marvel at this architectural anomaly, making it a symbol of both Italy and human ingenuity.
